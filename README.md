Hello, my name is Yi Zheng, Let's get started!

1. Quick scanï¼š  
(1) In the tweet_input directory, the input tweets.txt has size 27.3M, including 9999 tweets, this file is from data-gen directory.The corresponding output output.txt is in tweet_output directory.  
(2) In insight_testsuite directory, I made two simple tests. You can find the corresponding outputs in the tweet_output directory.  
(3) The codes are in src directory.
2. How to run test:  
I write all codes in Python, you can directly run test.py or my-own-test-2-tweets-larger60s.py or test-2-tweets-all-distinct.py and will get results in the corresponding directory.
